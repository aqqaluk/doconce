___Doconce could be handy for quickly writing slides___

__Reasons to use Doconce for slides:__

* Basic slides consists of bullet lists

* These are quicker to write in Doconce format than in latexslides

* Extra intro/outro blocks are also easy to add

* Figures need manual placement since Doconce has no north, east, west,
  south specifications as part of the format


___How to parse Doconce slides___

* Parsing is the difficult issue since the output format should be
  latexslides, which is Python, which requires start and stop
  "tags" (parenthesis and quotes typically) for the various elements
  (list items, bullet lists, etc.).

* One idea: Parse Doconce to rst, then to XML, and with XML we have
  start and end tags of all elements in the document.
  We should then be able to parse the XML and write out the equivalent
  latexslides code in Python.

___Some suggestions for the Doconce slide format___

* Subsubsections define slide titles

* Bullet lists are as in other formats

* A paragraph imples the heading of a block
